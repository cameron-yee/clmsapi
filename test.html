    <p class="body-font-size-adjust">What is science? What is inquiry? As a student, you might think of science
        as just another course to take each year in school. In <em>BSCS Middle School
        Science: Science as Inquiry</em>, you will have an opportunity to expand your
        views of science. As you work with your classmates and teacher in your science
        course this year, you will have the opportunity to do science (figure 1.1). You will be
        asking and trying to answer questions about concepts in science. The activities
        will encourage you to do science through inquiry. Doing science through inquiry is
        something you will learn about in this first chapter. You will be actively involved in
        your learning about science, inquiry, and interesting concepts that apply to your
        everyday life. And, hopefully, you will have fun along the way! Doesn’t doing
        science sound like more fun than just reading about science? That’s what science as
        inquiry is all about!</p>
    
    <p class="body-font-size-adjust">As you begin using your e-book this year, you will notice that each chapter is
        divided into activities that have a name that begins with an E. The names of the
        sections in each chapter are Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate.</p>
        
    <p class="body-font-size-adjust">As you begin using your e-book this year, you will notice that each chapter is
        divided into activities that have a name that begins with an E. The names of the
        sections in each chapter are Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. These words describe five phases that you will use as you learn a major concept. Your ideas and understandings about a major idea will change as you go through each phase. You will go through the phases in order and once per chapter. Each E
        has specific learning goals and expectations that your e-book and your teacher will
        use as you complete an activity. Each phase builds on the one before it. In this way,
        the 5Es will help you get the most out of your learning.</p>

    <p class="body-font-size-adjust">The flow of learning experiences through each of the Es may seem different to
        you. Some of the initial activities in a chapter might ask you to do something that
        seems unfamiliar—for example, to share your ideas on a concept you haven’t
        studied yet. This might seem unusual at first. What if you’re wrong!? But guess
        what? Sharing your ideas about a concept before learning what scientists think
        makes learning easier! Sharing your ideas helps you figure out what you already
        know and what you might be interested in learning. Then you have a “goal” to keep
        in mind as you learn more about scientists’ ideas. You’ll get to practice sharing your
        initial ideas about a topic many times in this e-book. You’ll also get to try to explain
        things in the natural world. Scientists often have to share their best ideas, and these
        ideas are often explanations of the natural world. Then as they learn more, they
        revise their ideas to show their new learning. That’s what science is all about! Once
        you’ve formed your own ideas, you’ll get to compare your explanations to those
        that a scientist might give. Then you will show what you’ve learned. You go through
        all these phases because that’s what scientists do and it makes learning easier. What
        a good combination!</p>

    <p class="body-font-size-adjust">By the end of this chapter, Science as Inquiry, you will</p>
